# FlightPrediction
Trying to predict flight delay, using Delta Airlines data found "U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Flight Delays Dataset"
and weather data from the "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)"
using scheduled departure time and scheduled arrival time
and the weather factors such as temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and visibility in the destination and origin airports
